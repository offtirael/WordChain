WordChain
=========

Prototype application that implements some of the models from the article "Models and Metamodels for Computer-Assisted Natural Language Grammar Learning" (http://waset.org/Publication/models-and-metamodels-for-computer-assisted-natural-language-grammar-learning/10000114).

Main components:
 - Meta-element editor is developed to support creating new meta-elements (like objects, actions, determiners, etc.) to be used for grammar structure constructions.
 - Grammar rule editor is used to construct rules and rule chains in the form of visual grammar structures connecting meta-elements and dictionary elements.
 - Learner panel allows learners to construct sentences with grammar and dictionary elements, following grammar rules defined by a teacher. Learners deal with concrete implementations of meta-elements in form of words classified with respect to their grammar role.
